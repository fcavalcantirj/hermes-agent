"""Session adapter for the claude-agent-sdk runtime.

Owns one Claude Agent SDK client per Hermes session — the structural twin of
``codex_app_server_session.py``, with the Codex JSON-RPC subprocess replaced
by Anthropic's official ``claude-agent-sdk`` (which manages the Claude Code
CLI subprocess, its agent loop, and — critically — **subscription OAuth**:
``CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`` / the ``~/.claude`` credential store, never a
metered ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY``). See GitHub issue #25267.

Lifecycle:
    session = ClaudeAgentSdkSession(cwd="/home/x/proj", model="claude-opus-4-8")
    session.ensure_started()                       # loop thread + SDK connect
    result = session.run_turn(user_input="hello")  # blocks until ResultMessage
    session.close()                                # disconnect + stop loop

Threading model: the SDK is async-first, but AIAgent.run_conversation() is
synchronous (the same constraint that made CodexAppServerClient thread-based).
The adapter owns a dedicated background thread running one asyncio event loop
for the whole session lifetime; every SDK coroutine is marshaled onto it with
``asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`` and awaited with a timeout, so the SDK
client keeps stable loop affinity and ``run_turn`` stays blocking.

        Hermes used to call `receive_response()` once per turn. That helper
        returns the OLDEST buffered ResultMessage — not necessarily this
        turn's — and the SDK offers no per-turn correlator (`query()` takes
        only a `session_id`, which is constant across turns; `ResultMessage`
        has a `uuid` with no request-side counterpart). Ordering is therefore
        the ONLY thing keeping answers matched to questions.

        The Claude Code CLI breaks that ordering by itself: when a background
        Agent task completes it injects a `<task-notification>` and runs a
        FULL assistant turn nobody asked for, leaving an unconsumed
        ResultMessage in the shared FIFO. Every later turn then pops a stale
        result. Because a desynced turn still looks like success — no error,
        no timeout, no interrupt — no retire path fires, so the skew is
        permanent and silent. Observed live 2026-07-25: four such turns left a
        constant off-by-4 for hours (dasbrow-hermes-coder#2).
