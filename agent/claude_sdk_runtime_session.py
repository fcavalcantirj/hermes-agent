"""Session creation and per-turn wiring for the claude-agent-sdk runtime.

What used to be closures nested in ``run_claude_agent_sdk_turn`` are small
owner objects and module-level functions that take the agent explicitly; the
session receives the per-agent ones bound with ``functools.partial``. Lifetime
split kept visible: ``_make_visibility_callbacks`` refreshes every turn, while
``_create_session`` (approval callback, prompt append, budget, bridge inputs) is
session-creation work. Extracted from ``claude_sdk_runtime.py``.
